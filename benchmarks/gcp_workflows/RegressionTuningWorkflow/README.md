 This directory includes the implementation of the RegressionTuning benchmark for Google Cloud Workflows. The subdirectories contain the code for the Google Functions that participate in the workflow, while the [yaml file](./workflow.yaml) provides the workflow definition.

To use the benchmark, you'll need to edit `workflow.yaml` with the appropriate paths to the Google functions in your account.
