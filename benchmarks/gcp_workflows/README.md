This directory contains system benchmarks adjusted to run on [Google Cloud Workflows](https://cloud.google.com/workflows). The code sources for all the benchmarks are referenced in the previous directory.

Please note that within each sub-directory (excluding DNAVisualization, which is a single-function benchmark), you will find a YAML file that defines the benchmark's workflow on Google Workflows. In the `init` step of each `workflow.yaml` file, the projectID and location of the helper Google Functions are specified. You do not need to modify these values, as they will be automatically set at runtime. However, when creating Google Functions using the provided code, ensure that the location of these functions matches the region of your Google Workflow. For example, if you have selected `us-central1` as the region to run your Cloud Functions, make sure to use the same region in your Google Workflow instances. Additional information on Google Functions Locations can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/locations).
