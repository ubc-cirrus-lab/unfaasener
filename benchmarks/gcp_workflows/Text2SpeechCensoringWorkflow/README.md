 This directory includes the implementation of the Text2SpeechCensoring benchmark for Google Cloud Workflows. The subdirectories contain the code for the Google Functions that participate in the workflow, while the [yaml file](./Text2SpeechCensoring_Benchmark.yaml) provides the workflow definition.

To use the benchmark, you'll need to edit `Text2SpeechCensoring_Benchmark.yaml` with the appropriate paths to the Google functions in your account.
